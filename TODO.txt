TO-DO list ft_irc project :

1- Creation of README.md : what to put in it ?

2- Design Client Class :
    - What does it contain ? (address, IP....)
    - Should it be a dynamic array ? (versus fixed size already declared)
    - is it a member of Server ? (probably)

3- use of setsockopt() : free the port used for the server
(as for now you should wait for a few minutes before reusing it -> kernel wait for packages)

4- Design of throw -> try/catch instead of classic error printing (usage of errno ?)
